Git (Version Control System)
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people.

Key Git Concepts
Repository (repo): A project folder that Git tracks
Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
Branch: An independent line of development
Merge: Combining changes from different branches
Clone: Creating a local copy of a remote repository
Pull: Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository
Push: Uploading local changes to a remote repository

Essential Git Commands
git init                    # Initialize a new repository
git add <file>             # Stage files for commit
git commit -m "message"    # Create a commit with a message
git status                 # Check repository status
git log                    # View commit history
git branch                 # List branches
git checkout <branch>      # Switch branches
git merge <branch>         # Merge branches
git pull                   # Fetch and merge remote changes
git push                   # Upload changes to remote repository
GitHub (Git Hosting Platform)
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools.
Key GitHub Features

Remote repositories: Store your code in the cloud
Pull requests: Propose and review changes before merging
Issues: Track bugs, features, and tasks
Actions: Automated workflows (CI/CD)
Pages: Host static websites
Organizations: Manage team access and permissions
Forks: Create personal copies of other repositories

GitHub Workflow

Fork or clone a repository
Create a new branch for your feature
Make changes and commit them
Push changes to your remote repository
Create a pull request to propose changes
Review and merge the pull request

Collaboration Benefits

Multiple developers can work simultaneously
Track all changes with detailed history
Backup and sync across devices
Code review process improves quality
Issue tracking and project management
Open source community participation

Git handles the version control locally, while GitHub provides the remote hosting and collaboration features that make team development seamless.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
